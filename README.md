# GameOfThrones

Test project for [SkillBranch's Android Middle course](http://skill-branch.ru/android.html). It uses [an API of Ice and Fire](https://anapioficeandfire.com/) to show information about main houses of Westeros: Stark, Lannister and Targarien.

If you want to try this app you can compile it from source or use [compiled apk](https://github.com/kenrube/GameOfThrones/blob/master/GameOfThrones-%7B0.0.3%7D-debug.apk).
